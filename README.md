Current mod version: 1.0.0.0
Minetest Mod made by KikaRz and DarkDracoon, that contains some simple or complex blocks that can be used to patterns on
the floor, on simply, to paint the walls.

```
You can create different mixtures.
Really...
White
 | |
 \ /
 ___
|___| <- White Color
|___| <- Red Color
 / \
 | |
 Red
How to do this
First of all:
How to craft colors?
X G X
G W G <- W = Wool, of WHAT COLOR YOU WANT and Glass
X G X
Second:
Turning 2 colors into 1 block (like, patterning and compacting...)
X W X <- W = White
X R X <- R = Red
X X X
This can be confuse at the initial part, but you'll see that will be great :)
